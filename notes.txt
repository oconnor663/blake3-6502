When I forgot to connect the ground wire on the Arduino, I got crazy reads from
the clock.

Forgetting the RTS at the end of a function makes everything go crazy.

I still constantly forget to use # for immediate values with LDA etc.

The BRK instruction needs a NOP or similar after it, because it skips the next
byte.

When comparing two bytes, don't use BMI to check for negative, because the
result of subtraction will wrap back around to positive when the difference is
>128. Use BCC instead.
